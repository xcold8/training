			Learn about jQuery GET (communicate with server) 
				Read these 2:
				- https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_ajax_get_post.asp
				- http://www.jquery-tutorial.net/ajax/the-get-and-post-methods/

			You then should understand that $.get is a function that gets a url and a callback, 
			sends a GET request to the given URL and calls back with callback() when finished
			(with the result from server within it).

			Your task is to make a $.get request to the following url:
			- https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

			This url should return JSON representing a list of users.
			You should replace the dummy hard-coded items in the html with these
			dynamic records given from the server.

			Good luck.
